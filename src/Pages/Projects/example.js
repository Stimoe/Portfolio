              The year is 2116 and the the United Nations of Governments are on
              the brink of war with Coalition of Corporations. The Gaberial
              virus has shattered the loosely held peace and both parties are
              desperately looking for the cure as they believe it will give them
              the winning hand when the conflict begins.

              Rumor on the street is that Dr. C Wheetman has found a cure but is
              going to hand it off to an unknown organization that believes the
              cure should be free for everyone

              Thomas S. your loremaster has been given the mission to deliver
              the code for the cure but you’ve been betrayed by the Jonas Clan,
              both the Corporations and the Governments now know who you are and
              that you have the code. They have sent their top assets to
              retrieve it from you!
